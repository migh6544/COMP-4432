### Machine Learning for Data Science

This course explores machine learning techniques and theory. The course covers how to use
popular machine learning libraries to develop, train, evaluate, and deploy predictive models on
prepared data. Both design principles (machine learning types and tasks) and technical
tools/languages will be covered.

##### Objectives:
-  Distinguish between supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
-  Pre-process data and feature engineer to meet modeling requirements.
-  Select and employ appropriate Python libraries for training, testing, and validation of parametric and nonparametric predictive models.
-  Employ appropriate strategies to mitigate model overfitting and underfitting.
-  Optimize models via. hyperparameter selection and tuning.
-  Articulate the differences between ensemble and boosting algorithms.
-  Evaluate model results using appropriate objective functions.
-  Describe the strengths, limitations and tradeoffs of a given model.
-  Present model results.
